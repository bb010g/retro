# Display Word Information Upon Definition

This uses the `sys:current-file` and `sys:current-line` words from
the Unix implementation of RETRO to display some information about
a word's location as the words are defined.

Something similar could be used to generate a *tags* file or to
populate a runtime database of location information.
