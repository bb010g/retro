# Building RETRO on Windows

## C#: retro.cs

This is an implementation of `retro-repl` in C#. As with
`retro-repl` it requires the `ngaImage` in the current
directory when starting.

Building:

    csc retro.cs

You'll need to make sure your path has the CSC.EXE in it,
or provide a full path to it. Something like this should
reveal the path to use:

    dir /s %WINDIR%\CSC.EXE

I've only tested building this using Microsoft's .NET tools.
It should also build and run under Mono.
