# Obtaining RETRO

The RETRO source code can be obtained from http://forthworks.com/retro

## Stable Releases

I periodically make stable releases. This will typically happen
two to four times per year.

These are good for those needing a solid base that doesn't change
frequently.

## Snapshots

A lot of development happens between releases. I make snapshots
of my working source tree nightly (and often more often).

This is what I recommend for most users. It reflects my latest
system and is normally reliable as it's used daily in production.

## Repository

To stay fully current, use the repository.

I use a Fossil repository to manage development. To obtain a
copy of the repository install Fossil and:

```
fossil clone https://forthworks.com:8000 retro.fossil
mkdir retro
cd retro
fossil open /path/to/retro.fossil
```
