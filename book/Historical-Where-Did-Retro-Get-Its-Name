Heheh, here's the story: When I started playing with OS stuff
last year (not seriously), I was reading about some old things
like FORTH and ITS, dating back to the 1960's and 70's.  The
past few years in America, there's been a revival of disco
music (along with bell bottoms, platform shoes, and all that
crap) and they call it "retro".  Now, my OS was named by
musicians.. I was telling a fellow musician about my ideas,
how it would be cool to have a small OS that isn't bloated and
unmanageable like Windows... go back to the 70's and resurrect
a line of software that died out.  He goes "hmm.. sounds kinda
retro.."

I think it sounds kinda rebellious, which is a Good Thing now
that everybody hates the M$ empire. :) It seems like other
people are as sick of the future as I am.  Look at TUNES, the
idea there isn't to make some great new invention, just take
some decades-old ideas and combine them in one OS.  The first
time I saw Knuth's "Art of Computer Programming" in the library
I thought "god that looks old.. 1973!!! nevermind.."  Now it's
my programming bible.  Find me something better published in
the 90's.. if such a thing exists, it'll be like a needle in a
haystack.  "Newer" doesn't necessarily mean "better".

	New cars = flimsier
	New farming methods = more devastating
	New version of Netscape = more bloat, more bullshit

One thing is better now: computer hardware.  Give me 70's
software on 90's and 00's hardware :)
