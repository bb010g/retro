# RETRO 2020.10

This update has focused on improvements to the toolchain and
general cleaups and bug fixes.

Of particular note: when building the C implementation, you
can now override the image and stack sizes when building. For
Python users, the core toolchain (retro-unu, retro-muri, and
retro-extend) has now been implemented in Python as well as C,
so you can now build RETRO without needing a C compiler.

## Notable Bugs Fixed

- fixed a bug in the glossary that caused names to appear twice
  (reported by Kiyoshi)
- fixed a bug in retro-describe due to use of a deprecated word
- retro.py: fixed a bug in the stack depth reporting
  (thanks to Scott McCallum for reporting this)
- fixed the `sh` instruction (which was totally broken prior to
  this, thanks to Scott for reporting this)

## Build Improvements

- added a `make image-js` target to generate the image.js
- allow setting the image size, stack sizes when building

## Toolchain
