# RETRO 2019.10

The next release will be 2019.10.

This is a worthwhile release, bringing changes and improvements
in several areas.

64-Bit

RETRO has been 32-bit only since the days of RETRO2 apart from
some limited experiments with RETRO11. I'm pleased to say that
this release of RETRO12 adds support for building a system with
64-bit cells.

This carries the same limitations regarding instruction packing,
addressing, etc as the standard 32-bit system, and is not built
by default. If you want to build a 64-bit system, do:

    make clean; make CFLAGS="-O2 -DBIT64"

Compatibility

There are a few small breaks in compatibility.

`unix:time` was removed. There is some discussion ongoing about
this, but leaving it in would be problematic on 32-bit systems
in a couple of years when the counter overflows. For now, I have
added `clock:timestamp`, but the value of the epoch this uses
may change in the future.

Interface

The 'ok' prompt has been removed.
