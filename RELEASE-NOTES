# RETRO 2020.7

This is a small release.

## Renamings

I'm no longer using <> in word names. As such, the following are
renamed.

    Old                      New
    ======================   =====================
    file:open<for-writing>   file:open-for-writing
    file:open<for-append>    file:open-for-append
    file:open<for-reading>   file:open-for-reading
    times<with-index>        indexed-times
    var<n>                   var-n
    d:last<name>             d:last.name
    d:last<class>            d:last.class
    d:last<xt>               d:last.xt

The old names are still included by default as part of a compatibility
layer. This will be removed in the 2020.10 release and nightly snapshots
starting in August.

## Nga

- add a Swift implementation

This will be the basis for the next iOS and macOS App Store versions.
In 2020.7 it's still very new and lacks most I/O devices, but this will
be addressed over the next few months.

## Documentation

- Added build instructions for Haiku R1/Beta 2
- Updated the man page for `retro-unu` to cover code and test blocks
- Updated the general `retro` man page to note that RETRO runs in
  interactive mode by default

## Examples

- Several new examples were added
