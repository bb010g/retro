  underscores in word names

    Prior RETRO images had a patch that allowed underscores to be
    used in word names. In this release, the patch is no longer
    part of the standard library, but is still included on Unix
    targets by default. This might affect some users, if you are
    building a custom image, load package/allow-underscores-in-names.forth
    if you need this. This will no longer be loaded by default after
    the 2020.4 release.

  modularity

    Work towards allowing portions of the standard library to be
    optional is ongoing. During this, the internal organization of
    retro.forth is changing and some small parts may be duplicated
    in an effort to allow for more flexibility in the long term.
