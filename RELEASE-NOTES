# RETRO 2019.tbd

This is the current changelog for the next release of RETRO, which
is currently targetting a late fall release.

## Bug Fixes

- all
- build
- retro-unix
- examples

## Build

- now rebuild if the .retro source files are updated

## Core Language

## Documentation

- correct example for retro-compiler
- add notes on retro-tags

## Toolchain

- added retro-tags

## Examples

- new examples
  - retro-tags.retro
  - Gott.retro
  - namespaces.retro
- use .retro extension

## General

## I/O

- unix:time is now clock:timestamp

## Interfaces

- retro/unix
  - remove `ok`
  - clarify the use of `-s` startup flag

## Nga

New queries via fetch:

    -4 for min integer
    -5 for max integer

## Notes for the future:

You can now build a 64-bit RETRO by doing:

    make clean; make CFLAGS="-O2 -DBIT64"

This is not well tested yet, but everything should work as
normal, you just get a much larger integer range. Note that
this requires a newer version of the VM with added queries
via fetch to fully support.

----

This release changes a few things.

(1) `unix:time` is now removed
(2) `clock:timestamp` is added
(3) the system can now be built as a fully 64-bit system
    with minimal changes
(4) the `ok` prompt has been removed
