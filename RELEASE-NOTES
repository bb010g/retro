Prior RETRO images had a patch that allowed underscores to be
used in word names. In this release, the patch is no longer
part of the standard library, but is still included on Unix
targets by default. This might affect some users, if you are
building a custom image, load package/allow-underscores-in-names.forth
if you need this.
