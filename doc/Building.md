# Building RETRO

Requirements:

- a generic shell in `/bin/sh`
- standard unix tools (cp, rm, mv, cd)
- a c compiler (as `cc`)
- a standard libc and libm
- a unix-style host

You can either use `make` or just run `./build.sh` directly.

RETRO is known to build out of the box on FreeBSD, macOS, and
Linux. It'll also build fine under Cygwin if you are using a
Windows system.
