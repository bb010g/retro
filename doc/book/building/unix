# Building on BSD, Linux, macOS, and outher Inix Targets

RETRO is well supported on BSD (tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD), Linux, and macOS systems. It should build on any
of these
without issue.

## Requirements

- c compiler & linker
- standard headers
- make

## Process

For a standard 32-bit system:

Run `make`

For a 64-bit system:

Run `make OPTIONS=-DBIT64`

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe

## Issues

If you run into any build issues, please send details to
crc@forth.works so I can work on addressing them as quickly
as possible.
