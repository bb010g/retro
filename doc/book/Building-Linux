# Building RETRO on Linux

Building on Linux is pretty easy. You'll need to make sure
you have a C compiler, headers, and make.

## Requirements

- c compiler (tested: clang, tcc, gcc)
- development headers
- make

## Process

Run:

```
make
```

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe

## Troubleshooting

I've had issues building on Linux in the past. The GNU toolchain
can be quite problematic.

If the build fails, try:

    make -f GNUmakefile

or:

    mv GNUmakefile Makefile
    make

If none of these work, contact Charles with details and he will
work on finding a fix.
