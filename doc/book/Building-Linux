# Building RETRO on Linux

Building on Linux is pretty easy. You'll need to make sure
you have a C compiler, headers, and make.

## Requirements

- c compiler (tested: clang, tcc, gcc)
- development headers
- make

## Process

Run:

```
make -f Makefile.linux
```

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe
